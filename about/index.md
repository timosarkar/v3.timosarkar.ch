# Who I am

My name is Timo Sarkar (at time of writing this page 19 years old). I am a computer science student and currently doing a federal apprenticeship as a systems engineer. In my down-time I am active in three main fields. Quantum mechanics, neurotechnology and DeFi (decentralized finance). I will give you an in-depth overview of my relation to these research-fields in the section "Interests". Additionally I like to think about the future. I am particularly interested in interstellar habitats and the colonization of inter-planetary objects. If I'd choose my biggest role model, it would definitely be Elon Musk. I would choose him due to his extravagant, unconventional and innovative ideas.


# Interests and Research

As mentioned earlier, I like to inform myself about a variety to topics related, but not limited to technology. I will list the to me, most important fields.

# Quantum mechanics

Roughly 1.5 years ago I have stumbled upon an amazing talk from Yann Allain, hosted by 36C3. That was the first time I came in touch with quantum mechanics. It immediately fascinated me and I started reading and studying about quantum mechanics and quantum architectures. I have learned a lot about the fundamental logic of the three main quantum technologies (photonics, superconducting and ion-trapping QC). 

Quantum mechanics is a highly sophisticated topic. However, I did not deter by the fact that it was too complex. I read a lot about ion trapping quantum-computers and could to aqcuire the fundamental principles of quantum mechanics. Early 2022 I got in contact with Yann Allain himself. We had a conversation about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics. Since then, it is my dream to build a conceptualized quantum computer prototype based on the research of yann allain. 

I wrote a research paper at academia.edu, in which I have explained a concept for a quadrupole calcium ion-trapping quantum computer. It includes the design of a laser-optics system for doppler-cooling, an ultra-high vacuum chamber (UHV) and the design of a quadrupole ion trap capturing polarized calcium ions.

# Neurotechnology

This is a field that I got into pretty recently. I think it is very important to gain a better overview on neuroscientific topics. Currently the human brain is probably the most unknown biological part of the human. My aim is to interdisciplinary educate myself in various topics such as: deep-learning, unsupervised-learning, stable diffusion, natural-language processing and understanding, brain simulation, genetic programming and evolution theory.

# DeFi (decentralized finance)

# Futurism and Visioneering

# Design and Marketing 

I am a big fan of minimalism and abstract brutalism
